### Who am I? 

I'm [Nick](https://www.twitter.com/@cleanCodeNick). I'll be completing each of these challenges using C#. I claim to be no expert in either computer programming or maths. Infact a case could be made that, at the moment of writing this, rubbish at both. I intend on working through this at a steady pace. Below I will list each completed challenge, it's code & a detail marking my completion date. 

### What is Project Euler?  

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical skills to solve. Although mathes helps to arrive at elegant and often efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for inquiring minds to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.  

### Who are the problems aimed at?  

The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.

### Can anyone solve the problems?  

The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.  

### How is this repo laid out?  
* *Euler100* is a class library, containing .cs files that hold the methods to each of the challenges.      
* *Euler100.Tests* will hold a test using the MSTest framework.  
* *Euler100Console* simply runs the class library methods using the program.cs file in the Console.
