One problem I found while working through this series of challenges is that the actual answers arent 
forthcoming. More often than not, I wanted to code the solution myself but check the result was infact correct. When searching for the ACTUAL answer to the maths problem. I would come accross 101 different code snippets that did not contain the actual problem to the question I was facing.

This file will contain the answers to all of the problems I have completed and those I am working on currently.
